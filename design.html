			<h2>Skyline Bracelets</h2>
			<p>This project was part of the class Real Products, Real Markets at Olin College of Engineering. This project was to design, prototype, market, and sell a product in four weeks. The requriement for the project was that the product had to be chemically etched into metal. We used Adobe Illustrator to create our designs.</p>
			<img src="style/images/bracelet.jpg" alt="Chicago skyline bracelet">
			<p>Our product was a line of bracelets with city skylines on them. Our goal was to help people build their connection to places they love by offering major cities. We also allowed people to place customized orders for other cities. We also expanded into creating bracelets for different groups on and off campus.</p>
			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>When we had a design we liked we used a vinyl cutter to see how it looked on paper. After we made sure our design worked we compiled a sheet with all of the ordered bracelets. This file was then sent to a company to chemically metal etch the bracelets. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chisahuang?fref=ts">facebook page</a> for more photos.</p>

			<h2>The FlatJack</h2>
			<p>This was the 2nd project for Real Products, Real Markets at Olin College of Engineering. Our team had to design, prototype, market, and sell a product in four weeks. We used Adobe Illustrator to create our design.</p>
			<img src="style/images/flatjack.png" alt="3d render of flatjack">
			<p>This is a stainless steel tool that has everything you need to make professional sketches. It features a compass, english and metric rulers, protractor, line tool, grid tool, straightedge, and square. The card is the size of a standard credit card.

			<h2>User-Oriented Collaborative Design for LARPers</h2>
			<p>I took this class Spring of 2011. The basis of this class was to learn and experience the user-oriented design process. I worked with a team of 3 other students from Olin College of Engineering. We went through an iterative process of interviewing, ideating, collaborating, participating, and prototyping.</p>
			<p>The user group we designed for were Live Action Role Players aka LARPers. LARPers are groups of people who go out to fields or campsites and spend the weekend role playing. This role playing consists of various adventuring and acting through the eyes of a character they create. In a nut shell it is the real life version of the table top game Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
			<h3>How LARPs work</h3>
			At a LARP you will find three different roles. Game Masters (GM), Player Charathers (PC), and non-player characters (NPC).
			<ul>
			    <li>GM run and manage the event. They control everything at the LARP event. They organize getting a camp ground for the weekend to creating the story and quests for the weekend.</li>
			    <li>PC pay to play at the event. PC have created their own character for this LARP group. They come to the LARP and expect to have fun, go on quests, and kill a ton of bad guys.</li>
			    <li>NPC are volunteers for the event. They get orders from the GM on what to do. These can vary from the GM saying "set this quest up" to "Nothing has happened at town in a while--I need 4 of you to be dress up as goblins and attack the town". Their goal is to make sure the PCs have a fun weekend by following the orders of the GM.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Final Design</h3>
			<p>Our final product was a system that would allow GMs to wireless communicate with the NPCs in order to keep the LARP exciting the entire weekend. This would allow the PCs to have a more immersive experience at the LARP.</p>
