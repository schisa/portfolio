                <h3>Protohack: 2016</h3>
                <p>From the protohack site: ProtoHack requires no coding. Instead you'll be using prototyping tools, drag and drop editors, mockups, wireframes and anything else you think of to visually demo your idea on stage. Competitors will work in teams (up to 5) or solo. You have 9 hours to prototype your idea and then you'll present on stage.</p>
